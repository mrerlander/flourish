Description: We envision building a platform to allow small businesses to meet and exceed their financial goals by allowing them to automatically save money on their own terms.

Businesses can either set up their account to save for a rainy day fund and/or opt in for event-based savings.

- Rainy Day Fund
	- Businesses can choose what percent of their net profit they'd like to save on a daily or weekly basis. 
- Event Based Savings
	- Businesses can indicate an event they'd like to save for and our algorithm will automatically adjust their savings rate based on the amount of money the business needs and the date they need it by
- Common Event-Based Savings
	-  Adding a new location
	-  Adding a new employee
	-  Buying new equipment
- Engagement
	- We plan to send out a transactional welcome email after the new user completes the form to welcome them to the Flourish community and give them insight into how the product develops over time.
We plan to send out a monthly email to provide updates to the network of users on upcoming product releases and general updates about the company.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Materialize, Javascript, Node.JS, Express, SendGrid, MongoDB, React.JS
